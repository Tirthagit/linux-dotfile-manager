# 📚 Contributing to Dotfiles, my dotfiles utility project for Linux based systems  

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!  
This is a beginner-friendly project aimed at building a **Linux dotfiles managing, testing and provisioning utility**, and your help is truly appreciated. ❤️

## 📘 About This Project  

This is a Linux-focused dotfiles utility project I (Tirtharaj) started as a part of my learning journey  
in DevOps and Linux configuration management. It includes features like:

- ✅ Multi-distro Docker testing (Ubuntu, Fedora, Manjaro, Mint, CentOS)
- ✅ Vagrant and Podman support
- ✅ WSL2 handling
- ✅ Starship prompt, ASCII art on login
- ✅ systemd services and automation (logrotate, install logs, etc.)

⚠️ Note: I am still learning. Some parts may be incomplete or even technically incorrect. I would love your guidance, suggestions, and corrections!

## 💡 Why I Need Help

I am doing this as a **learning project**, and while I wrote many parts myself, I do **not fully understand everything** yet.

- I want this to be a real-world, production-worthy utility
- But I need guidance, best practices, and review from experienced developers
- I'm open to PRs, suggestions, refactors, or even complete rewrites of parts if needed

Please don’t judge — instead, help me grow. 🌱  
Let’s build this **by learning together**!
